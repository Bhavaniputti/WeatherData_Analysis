# 🌤️ Weather Data Analysis using Pandas & Seaborn

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on monthly temperature data and visualizes average temperatures for each month using a bar chart.

## 📊 Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze a dataset containing monthly temperature values and present them in a meaningful and visually appealing way.

### ✅ Key Features
- Data cleaning using `pandas`
- Grouping and aggregation by month
- Monthly average temperature calculation
- Visualization with `seaborn` and `matplotlib`
- Enhanced plot styling with labels and color palettes

## 📁 Dataset

- The dataset contains monthly temperature data.
- Columns: `Month`, `Temperature` (or `AverageTemperature` depending on your dataset)

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository or open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Upload the dataset if it's not already included.
3. Run the cells to perform the analysis and generate the plot.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-data-analysis.git
📌 To-Do
 .Add more visualizations (e.g., line plots, box plots)

 .Add temperature comparison across years (if dataset allows)

 .Deploy as a Streamlit or Flask web app (optional)
